# Bills Page Filter Fix - Final Summary

## What Was Done

Fixed critical bug where bills were disappearing from the Bills page when their status changed. The primary issue was in `RecurringBillManager.processBills()` which was resetting all bill statuses to `undefined`, causing skipped bills to lose their status.

## The Fix (4 Lines of Code)

### 1. Preserve Skipped Status (1 line)
**File:** `frontend/src/utils/RecurringBillManager.js` (line 150)

```javascript
status: bill.status === 'skipped' ? 'skipped' : undefined
```

### 2. Update Button Text (2 lines)
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Bills.jsx` (lines 1747, 1749)

```javascript
<button title="Mark this bill as unpaid">Mark Unpaid</button>
```

### 3. Add Test Coverage (18 lines)
**File:** `frontend/src/utils/BillVisibilityAndCount.test.js`

Added Test 7: "Skipped status is preserved through bill processing"

## Results

✅ **All 5 requirements met:**
1. 'All Status' filter shows ALL bills (paid, unpaid, overdue, skipped, etc.)
2. Bill count matches actual number of bills (displays "X of Y")
3. 'Mark Unpaid' button exists for paid bills
4. Status toggling only changes status, never hides/deletes bills
5. UI reflects all bills and correct counts

✅ **All 13 tests passing**
- 7 tests in BillVisibilityAndCount.test.js
- 6 tests in BillsPageFilterIntegration.test.js

✅ **Build successful with no errors**
