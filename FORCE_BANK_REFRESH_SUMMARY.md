# Force Bank Refresh Feature - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Users were unable to see pending transactions from their bank immediately because:
- Plaid polls banks automatically every 1-6 hours
- Users had to wait or manually sync repeatedly, hoping Plaid had new data
- No way to force Plaid to check the bank on-demand

**Example:** A Render.com $1.00 charge shows as pending in SoFi's website but doesn't appear in the app even after multiple syncs because Plaid hasn't checked the bank recently.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Added a "Force Bank Check" feature that:
1. Tells Plaid to check the bank **RIGHT NOW** (via `transactionsRefresh()` API)
2. Waits 3 seconds for Plaid to retrieve data
3. Automatically syncs the new transactions
4. Displays new pending transactions in ~5 seconds total

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Button Appearance

**Normal State:**
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│  🔄 Force Bank Check   │  ← Green (#28a745)
└────────────────────────┘
```

**Active State:**
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│  ⏳ Checking Bank...   │  ← Gray (#999)
└────────────────────────┘
```

**Disabled State:**
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│  🔒 Force Bank Check   │  ← Gray (#6b7280), 60% opacity
│     (Not Connected)    │
└────────────────────────┘
```

### Button Location

The button appears in the Transactions page action row:

```
[ 🔄 Sync Plaid Transactions ]  [ 🔄 Force Bank Check ]
        BLUE                           GREEN
```

## ⏱️ User Flow Timeline

```
0s    User clicks "Force Bank Check"
      └─> Shows: ⏳ Checking Bank...
      └─> Notification: "Plaid is checking your bank now..."

0-3s  Backend calls plaidClient.transactionsRefresh()
      Plaid immediately polls the bank

3s    Frontend automatically triggers syncPlaidTransactions()
      └─> Shows: 🔄 Syncing...

3-4s  Transactions sync from Plaid to Firebase

4-5s  UI updates with new transactions
      └─> Notification: "Successfully synced X new transactions (Y pending)"

✅    New pending transactions appear!
```

**Total Time:** ~5 seconds from click to new transactions visible
