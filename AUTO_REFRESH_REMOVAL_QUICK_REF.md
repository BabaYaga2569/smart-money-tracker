## 🔍 How to Verify Fix

### 1. Check Console (Browser DevTools)
**Before:**
```
Auto-refresh attempt 1 (30s interval)
Auto-refresh attempt 2 (30s interval)
Auto-refresh attempt 3 (30s interval)
... every 30 seconds ...
```

**After:**
```
(silence - no auto-refresh logs)
```

### 2. Check Network Tab
**Before:**
- `/api/accounts` called every 30-60 seconds automatically

**After:**
- `/api/accounts` only called on:
  - Page load
  - Manual refresh button click

### 3. Check Plaid Dashboard
**Before:**
- ~1,440 API calls per day
- ~$14/day if page stays open

**After:**
- ~10 API calls per day
- ~$0.10/day total

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Will users notice any difference?
**A:** No! Functionality is identical. Webhooks + manual refresh provide same experience.

### Q: What if webhooks fail?
**A:** Users can always use manual refresh button. Data also loads from Firestore cache.

### Q: Can we rollback if needed?
**A:** Yes, just revert the commits. But unlikely to be needed.

### Q: Why remove auto-refresh instead of reducing frequency?
**A:** Webhooks already provide real-time updates. Polling is redundant, not needed at all.

### Q: What about other pages?
**A:** This change only affects Accounts page. Other pages don't have aggressive polling.
