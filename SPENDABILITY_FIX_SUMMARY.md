# Spendability Bugs Fix - Quick Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Fixed two critical bugs that persisted after PR #103:

1. **Bug 1:** "Available until" date showing 10/08/2025 (today) instead of 10/15/2025 (wife's payday) ✅
2. **Bug 2:** Dashboard showing $1,746 instead of $1,596.12 (missing $150 weekly essentials) ✅

---

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### Minimal Code Changes (2 lines in Spendability, 30 lines in Dashboard)

#### 1. Spendability.jsx - Line 150
**Added one field:**
```javascript
type: settingsData.paySchedules?.spouse?.type,  // ✅ This one line fixes Bug 1
```

#### 2. Dashboard.jsx - Lines 140-171
**Added fallback payday calculation logic:**
```javascript
// Now calculates payday if Firebase data is missing/stale
else if (data.paySchedules) {
  const result = PayCycleCalculator.calculateNextPayday(
    yoursSchedule,
    { type: spouse.type, amount: spouse.amount }  // ✅ Includes type field
  );
}
```

## 🧪 Tests

Created `PayCycleCalculator.test.js` with 4 tests:
- ✅ Test 1: Spouse bi-monthly schedule recognized
- ✅ Test 2: Works with amount only (backward compatible)
- ✅ Test 3: Type field takes precedence
- ✅ Test 4: Days until payday calculated correctly

**All tests passing!**

## 🎉 Why It Works Now

**Root Cause:** The spouse schedule object was missing the `type: 'bi-monthly'` field when passed to PayCycleCalculator.

**The Fix:** 
- Spendability now passes the `type` field → PayCycleCalculator can detect bi-monthly schedule
- Dashboard now has fallback logic → Recalculates if Firebase data is stale
- Both pages use identical logic → Always show matching values

**Result:** Both bugs fixed with minimal, surgical changes! 🔥
