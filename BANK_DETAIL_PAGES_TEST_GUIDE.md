## Browser Compatibility

Test in:

## Known Limitations

1. **Transaction Limit:** Maximum 500 transactions per account
   - This is by design for performance
   - If user needs more, they can adjust date filters

2. **Current Month Only:** Stats only calculate for current calendar month
   - Future enhancement: Allow selecting different months

3. **No Transaction Editing:** View-only page
   - Users must go to Transactions page to edit
   - This is by design - focused on viewing per bank
