- **2 new components** - Payment history modal
- **~700 lines of code** - New functionality
- **3 CSS animations** - Visual feedback

### Features Delivered
- ✅ Payment history tracking with export

- ✅ Priority-based bill sorting (overdue always at top)
- ✅ Paid bill management (move to bottom)
- ✅ Auto-matching payment recording
- ✅ Monthly payment summaries
- ✅ CSV export for tax records
- ✅ Plaid transaction linking

## 🔥 Critical Fixes

### Fix #1: Bills Now Mark as Paid Properly
**Before:** Bills updated due date but didn't record payment
**After:** Every payment creates a complete record with:
- Bill details (name, amount, category)
- Payment dates (due date, paid date)
- Payment method (Auto/Manual)
- Overdue status (days late)
- Transaction link (Plaid)

**Result:** Users have proof of every payment for taxes/records

### Fix #2: Overdue Bills Stay Visible
**Before:** Bills auto-updated due date and disappeared to bottom
**After:** Overdue bills:
- Stay at top of list (position #1)
- Show red pulsing border (impossible to miss)
- Display days overdue
- Show warning: "⚠️ LATE FEES MAY APPLY!"
- Due date stays the same until paid

**Result:** Users never forget to pay bills, avoiding late fees
