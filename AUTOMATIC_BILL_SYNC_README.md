# Automatic Bill Sync - Quick Start Guide

## What's New? 🎉

Your recurring bills system just got smarter! Now, when you make changes to recurring templates, the Bills Management page automatically updates—no manual "Generate Bills" needed.

## Key Benefits

### Before This Feature ❌
- Had to manually click "Generate Bills from Templates"
- Bills Management could be out of sync with templates
- No feedback on what changed
- Risk of duplicate bills
- Had to refresh to see changes

### After This Feature ✅
- Bills automatically sync when you save templates
- Immediate feedback on changes (e.g., "Bills: 2 added, 1 updated")
- Paid bills preserved as history
- No duplicate bills possible
- Always in sync between pages

## How It Works

### 1. Creating a New Template
```
You: Create "Netflix" template ($15.99/month)
System: ✓ "Recurring item added! Bills: 3 added"
Result: 3 future Netflix bills automatically created
```

### 2. Editing a Template
```
You: Change Netflix amount to $17.99
System: ✓ "Recurring item updated! Bills: 3 updated"
Result: Future unpaid bills updated, paid bills preserved
```

### 3. Selecting/Unselecting Months
```
You: Add February and March to Sports Tickets
System: ✓ "Recurring item updated! Bills: 2 added, 3 updated"
Result: New bills created for Feb and Mar
```

```
You: Remove February and March
System: ✓ "Recurring item updated! Bills: 2 removed, 3 updated"
Result: Future bills for Feb and Mar deleted (paid bills kept)
```

### 4. Pausing a Template
```
You: Pause gym membership
System: ✓ "Item paused (3 future bills removed)"
Result: Future unpaid bills removed, paid bills preserved
```

### 5. Resuming a Template
```
You: Resume gym membership
System: ✓ "Item resumed (3 bills generated)"
Result: Bills for next 3 months created
```

### 6. Deleting a Template
```
You: Delete template with "Also delete bills" checked
System: ✓ "Recurring item deleted (5 bills removed, 2 paid bills preserved)"
Result: Future bills deleted, historical paid bills kept
```

## FAQ

### Q: What happens to bills I already paid?
**A**: They're preserved forever as historical records. Never deleted or modified.

### Q: Do I still need to click "Generate Bills"?
**A**: No! Bills are automatically generated when you save templates. The "Generate Bills" button still works if you need it, but it will usually show "No new bills to generate."

### Q: What if I manually created a bill?
**A**: Manual bills are never touched by auto-sync. Only bills with the 🔄 Auto badge (from templates) are synced.

### Q: Can I undo a change?
**A**: Not automatically, but you can edit the template again to reverse your changes. The system will sync accordingly.

### Q: Does this work with custom month selection?
**A**: Yes! Custom months are fully supported. Select/unselect months and bills update automatically.

### Q: What happens if I delete a template?
**A**: You choose:
- **Don't delete bills**: Template removed, bills stay and can be managed manually
- **Delete bills**: Unpaid bills removed, paid bills preserved for history

### Q: Will this affect my existing bills?
**A**: No. Existing bills remain unchanged. Only when you edit a template will its bills be synced.

### Q: What about bills imported from CSV?
**A**: Bills with a `recurringTemplateId` will sync with their template. Bills without this ID (manual or some imports) are never affected.
