# Bill Deduplication Feature - Quick Start

## 🎯 Overview

The Bill Deduplication feature prevents and cleans up duplicate bills in Bills Management. It provides both **automatic** cleanup on page load and **manual** cleanup via a button.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Users

**Automatic Cleanup (Happens Automatically):**
1. Open Bills Management page
2. System automatically scans and removes duplicates
3. Notification shows if any were found
4. That's it! No action needed.

**Manual Cleanup (When You Want):**
1. Go to Bills Management
2. Click the **"🧹 Deduplicate Bills"** button
3. Confirm the action
4. View results in notification

### For Developers

**Running the Demo:**
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/smart-money-tracker/smart-money-tracker
node demo-bill-deduplication.js
```

**Building the Project:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Tests are in: frontend/src/utils/BillDeduplicationManager.test.js
# Demo validates all scenarios
node demo-bill-deduplication.js
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### What Makes a Duplicate?

A bill is considered a duplicate if **ALL** of these match:
- **Name** (case-insensitive: "Netflix" = "NETFLIX")
- **Amount** ($15.99)
- **Due Date** (2024-01-10)
- **Recurrence** (monthly)
- **Template ID** (if from recurring template)

### What's NOT a Duplicate?

✅ **Split Bills** - Same name/amount but different dates:
```
Rent $750 (Jan 15) ← KEPT
Rent $750 (Jan 30) ← KEPT
```

✅ **Different Frequencies** - Same bill but different recurrence:
```
Gym $50 (monthly) ← KEPT
Gym $50 (weekly) ← KEPT
```

✅ **Different Amounts** - Same name but different amount:
```
Internet $80 ← KEPT
Internet $90 ← KEPT
```

## 🎬 Example Scenarios

### Before Deduplication
```
1. Netflix - $15.99 - Jan 10 (monthly)
2. Netflix - $15.99 - Jan 10 (monthly) ← duplicate
3. Netflix - $15.99 - Jan 10 (monthly) ← duplicate
4. Spotify - $9.99 - Jan 15 (monthly)
5. Spotify - $9.99 - Jan 15 (monthly) ← duplicate
6. Rent - $1500 - Jan 1 (monthly)
```

### After Deduplication
```
1. Netflix - $15.99 - Jan 10 (monthly) ✓
2. Spotify - $9.99 - Jan 15 (monthly) ✓
3. Rent - $1500 - Jan 1 (monthly) ✓

Result: 3 duplicates removed (2 Netflix, 1 Spotify)
```

### Demo & Validation
```
demo-bill-deduplication.js               ← Validates all scenarios
```

## 🧪 Validation

All scenarios from the problem statement are validated:

✅ **Triplicates** - Netflix shown 3 times → reduced to 1  
✅ **Case-insensitive** - "Netflix" = "NETFLIX" = "netflix"  
✅ **Split bills preserved** - Different dates kept  
✅ **Different frequencies preserved** - monthly vs weekly kept  
✅ **Complex scenarios** - Mix of duplicates and legitimate bills  

**Demo Output:**
```
=== Bill Deduplication Demo ===
✅ All scenarios validated successfully!
✅ Deduplication logic working as expected
✅ First occurrence is always kept
✅ Case-insensitive matching works
✅ Different dates/frequencies/templates are NOT duplicates
```

## 🆘 Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Will I lose bills?**  
A: No. Only exact duplicates are removed. First occurrence is always kept.

**Q: What about split bills?**  
A: Split bills (different dates) are preserved and NOT removed.

**Q: How do I know what was removed?**  
A: Check browser console (F12) for detailed logs of all removed bills.

**Q: Can I undo deduplication?**  
A: Currently no, but only true duplicates are removed, so impact is minimal.

**Q: When should I use manual deduplication?**  
A: Automatic cleanup runs on every load, so manual is rarely needed. Use it for peace of mind or after bulk imports.

### Troubleshooting

**Button doesn't appear:**
- Check that you have bills in Bills Management
- Refresh the page

**Duplicates not being removed:**
- Check console logs for details
- Verify bills match exactly (name, amount, date, frequency)
- Different dates = different bills (preserved)

**Need more help?**
- Check [User Guide](DEDUPLICATION_USER_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions
- Review console logs (F12 → Console)
