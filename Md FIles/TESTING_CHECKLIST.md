## Issue 3: Fuzzy Matching Enhancement

### Test 3.1: Exact Match Still Works
- [ ] Create bill: "Netflix" - $15.99
- [ ] Run Match Transactions
- [ ] If Plaid has transaction "Netflix" - $15.99 (within 5 days)
- [ ] Verify bill is auto-matched

**Expected Result:** âœ… Exact matches still work

### Test 3.2: Partial Name Matching (Primary Test Case)
- [ ] Create bill: "Geico" - $125.00, due date within next 5 days
- [ ] Ensure Plaid has transaction: "Geico Insurance" or "GEICO" - $125.00 (recent)
- [ ] Run Match Transactions
- [ ] Verify bill is auto-matched
- [ ] Verify bill shows as paid with transaction details

**Expected Result:** âœ… "Geico" matches "Geico Insurance" or "GEICO"

### Test 3.3: Abbreviated Name Matching
- [ ] Create bill: "AT&T" - $80.00
- [ ] Ensure Plaid has transaction: "ATT Wireless" - $80.00 (recent)
- [ ] Run Match Transactions
- [ ] Verify bill is auto-matched

**Expected Result:** âœ… "AT&T" matches "ATT Wireless"

### Test 3.4: Common Word Matching
- [ ] Create bill: "Electric Bill" - $150.00
- [ ] Ensure Plaid has transaction: "PG&E Electric" - $150.00 (recent)
- [ ] Run Match Transactions
- [ ] Verify bill is auto-matched (due to common word "Electric")

**Expected Result:** âœ… Bills with common significant words match

### Test 3.5: No False Positives
- [ ] Create bill: "Verizon" - $100.00
- [ ] Ensure Plaid has transaction: "T-Mobile" - $100.00 (recent)
- [ ] Run Match Transactions
- [ ] Verify bill is NOT auto-matched (different companies)

**Expected Result:** âœ… Different companies do not incorrectly match

### Test 3.6: Case Insensitive
- [ ] Create bill: "geico sxs" - $125.00 (lowercase)
- [ ] Ensure Plaid has transaction: "GEICO" - $125.00 (uppercase, recent)
- [ ] Run Match Transactions
- [ ] Verify bill is auto-matched

**Expected Result:** âœ… Case differences do not prevent matching

### Test 3.7: Multiple Similar Bills
- [ ] Create two bills:
  - "Geico Auto" - $100.00
  - "Geico Rental" - $125.00
- [ ] Ensure Plaid has transaction: "Geico Insurance" - $125.00
- [ ] Run Match Transactions
- [ ] Verify only the $125.00 bill is matched (amount + name match)

**Expected Result:** âœ… Correct bill matched based on amount + name

## Integration Tests

### Test INT.1: Full Workflow
- [ ] Start fresh with unpaid bills
- [ ] Some bills should match transaction names partially
- [ ] Connect Plaid (if not connected)
- [ ] Click Match Transactions
- [ ] Verify appropriate bills are auto-matched
- [ ] Verify success notification with count
- [ ] Manually mark one remaining bill as paid
- [ ] Unmark that bill
- [ ] Verify it returns to unpaid state

**Expected Result:** âœ… Complete workflow functions smoothly

### Test INT.2: Error Recovery
- [ ] Disconnect internet
- [ ] Try to match transactions
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling
- [ ] Reconnect internet
- [ ] Retry operation
- [ ] Verify it now works

**Expected Result:** âœ… System recovers from errors gracefully

---

## Browser Compatibility

Test in multiple browsers:
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if available)

Verify all features work in each browser.

---

## Performance Tests

### Test PERF.1: Many Bills
- [ ] Create 50+ bills
- [ ] Run Match Transactions
- [ ] Verify operation completes within reasonable time (< 10 seconds)
- [ ] Verify UI remains responsive

**Expected Result:** âœ… Performance is acceptable with many bills

---

## Regression Tests

- [ ] Create new bill - works as before
- [ ] Edit existing bill - works as before
- [ ] Delete bill - works as before
- [ ] Filter bills by category - works as before
- [ ] Search bills - works as before
- [ ] Mark bill as paid manually - works as before
- [ ] Bill status badges display correctly
- [ ] Bill animations work (if applicable)

**Expected Result:** âœ… No regressions introduced

## Quick Test (5 Minutes)

If time is limited, run these critical tests:

1. **Plaid Button State:**
   - [ ] Remove Plaid token â†’ button disabled
   - [ ] Add Plaid token â†’ button enabled

2. **Fuzzy Matching:**
   - [ ] Create "Geico SXS" bill
   - [ ] Match with "Geico" transaction
   - [ ] Verify auto-match works

3. **Unmark Paid:**
   - [ ] Mark a bill as paid
   - [ ] Unmark it
   - [ ] Verify it returns to unpaid

If all three pass, core functionality is working. âœ…
