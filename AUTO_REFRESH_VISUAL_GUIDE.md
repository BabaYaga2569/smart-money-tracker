## UI Components

### 1. Total Balances Card
The existing Total Balances card remains unchanged, showing live and projected balances.

### 2. Refresh Status Bar (NEW)
Located directly below the Total Balances card, this bar displays the current refresh status:

#### State 1: Refreshing
```
🔄 Refreshing...    Last updated: 2 min ago
```
- **🔄 Refreshing...** - Green text with pulsing animation
- Appears briefly while fetching new data
- Does not block user interaction

#### State 2: Fresh Data
```
Last updated: just now
```
- Shows when data was recently refreshed
- Gray text, subtle and non-intrusive
- Updates automatically as time passes ("just now" → "2 min ago" → "5 min ago", etc.)

#### State 3: Stale Data Warning
```
Last updated: 12 min ago    ⚠️ Data may be outdated
```
- **⚠️ Data may be outdated** - Orange warning indicator
- Appears when data is older than 10 minutes
- Alerts user while auto-refresh continues in background
- Disappears automatically once fresh data arrives

- Automatically adapts based on time on page

### Concurrent Prevention
- Only one refresh request at a time
- Subsequent requests are queued/skipped
- Prevents Firebase rate limiting
