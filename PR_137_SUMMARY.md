# PR #137 - Fix Account Deletion Logic

## 🎯 Problem

PR #136 introduced a critical bug: deleting a single account would delete **ALL accounts** from the same bank.

### User Impact Example
```
User has USAA with:
  - Checking: $1,127.68 ✅ (wants to keep)
  - Savings: $234.29 ❌ (wants to delete)

User clicks "Delete" on Savings
Result: BOTH accounts deleted 💀
```

## ✅ Solution

Changed the deletion logic to target **individual accounts** instead of **entire banks**.

### Key Changes

1. **Filter by `account_id` instead of `item_id`**
   - `account_id` = unique per account
   - `item_id` = shared across all accounts from same bank

2. **Conditional `plaid_items` deletion**
   - Check if other accounts from same bank exist
   - Only delete access tokens when NO accounts remain

3. **Proper state management**
   - Update only the deleted account
   - Preserve all other accounts
   - Recalculate balances correctly

## 📝 Code Changes

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Accounts.jsx` (lines 336-410)

### Before (PR #136)
```javascript
// ❌ Deleted ALL accounts from bank
const updatedPlaidAccounts = (currentData.plaidAccounts || []).filter(
  acc => acc.item_id !== itemId  // Wrong filter!
);

// Always deleted plaid_items
await batch.commit();
```

### After (PR #137)
```javascript
// ✅ Delete ONLY the specific account
const updatedPlaidAccounts = (currentData.plaidAccounts || []).filter(
  acc => acc.account_id !== accountKey  // Correct filter!
);

// Check remaining accounts
const remainingAccountsFromBank = updatedPlaidAccounts.filter(
  acc => acc.item_id === itemId
);

// Conditionally delete plaid_items
if (remainingAccountsFromBank.length === 0) {
  // Delete only if no accounts remain
  await batch.commit();
} else {
  console.log('Kept plaid_items - other accounts remain');
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Build Status
```bash
✅ npm install - successful
✅ npm run build - successful
✅ eslint - no new errors
```

### Expected Behavior

**Test 1: Delete one account, keep others**
```
Initial: USAA Checking + Savings
Delete: USAA Savings
Result: ✅ Only Savings deleted, Checking preserved
```

**Test 2: Delete all accounts from bank**
```
Initial: SoFi Checking + Savings
Delete: SoFi Savings → Savings deleted, Checking preserved
Delete: SoFi Checking → All accounts gone, plaid_items cleaned up
Result: ✅ Sequential deletion, proper cleanup
```

## 📊 Impact

### Before PR #137
- ❌ User cannot delete individual accounts
- ❌ Deleting one account removes entire bank
- ❌ Lost data and bank connections
- ❌ Unpredictable behavior

### After PR #137
- ✅ Granular account-level deletion
- ✅ Bank connection preserved when accounts remain
- ✅ Safe data management
- ✅ Predictable, expected behavior

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Account object
{
  account_id: "acc_123",    // ← Unique per account (use for deletion)
  item_id: "item_bank",     // ← Shared across bank (don't use!)
  name: "USAA Checking",
  balance: "1127.68",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Filter Logic
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Deletes all accounts from bank
accounts.filter(acc => acc.item_id !== itemId)

// ✅ CORRECT - Deletes only specific account
accounts.filter(acc => acc.account_id !== accountKey)
```

### Conditional Cleanup
```javascript
// Check if other accounts from bank exist
const remaining = accounts.filter(acc => acc.item_id === itemId);

if (remaining.length === 0) {
  // Safe to delete plaid_items
  deletePlaidItems();
} else {
  // Keep plaid_items (other accounts need it)
  console.log(`${remaining.length} accounts remaining`);
}
```
