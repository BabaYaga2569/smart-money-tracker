# Page Load Performance Fix - Verification Guide

## Problem Statement
The Transactions page was taking **42 seconds** to load on first startup, causing users to see a blank page and potentially abandon the app.

## Root Cause
The `loadAccounts()` function was making an API call to the Render.com backend without any timeout:
- Render.com free tier has **cold starts** that can take 30-50 seconds
- The `fetch()` call had no timeout, waiting for the full browser timeout (~60s)
- This blocked the entire page from rendering

## Solution Implemented
Added a **3-second timeout** to the API call using `AbortController`:

```javascript
// Before: No timeout - waits forever
const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/api/accounts`, {
  headers: { ... }
});

// After: 3-second timeout - fast fallback to Firebase
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 3000);

const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/api/accounts`, {
  headers: { ... },
  signal: controller.signal  // Added abort signal
});

clearTimeout(timeoutId);
```

## Impact
- **Before:** 42-second wait on cold start
- **After:** ~1-2 second load from Firebase cache
- API still used when available and responds quickly
- Graceful degradation when API is slow/unavailable

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Fast Page Load (Primary Goal)
1. Open the app in a fresh browser session
2. Navigate to Transactions page
3. **Expected:** Page loads in 1-3 seconds with data from Firebase
4. **Verify:** No 42-second blank screen

### Test 2: API Timeout Behavior
1. Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Navigate to Transactions page
3. Look for request to `/api/accounts`
4. **Expected:** Request either completes quickly OR times out after 3 seconds
5. **Verify:** Console shows "API request timed out after 3s, using Firebase"

### Test 3: API Success Path
1. If API is responding quickly (< 3 seconds)
2. **Expected:** API data is used instead of Firebase
3. **Verify:** Console shows API response without timeout message

### Test 4: Auto-Sync Still Works
1. Wait for the page to load
2. Check console for auto-sync messages
3. **Expected:** Auto-sync runs in background (non-blocking)
4. **Verify:** Page shows data immediately, sync happens after

## Technical Details

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/Transactions.jsx` - Added timeout to `loadAccounts()`

### Code Changes
- Lines 179-191: Added `AbortController` with 3-second timeout
- Lines 260-268: Enhanced error handling for timeout detection

### Timeout Strategy
- **3 seconds** chosen as reasonable balance:
  - Fast enough to avoid user frustration
  - Slow enough to allow API on warm starts
  - Aligned with best practices for perceived performance

### Fallback Strategy
When API times out or fails:
1. Log warning to console
2. Call `loadFirebaseAccounts()`
3. Use cached data from Firebase
4. Page loads immediately

## Future Improvements (Out of Scope)
1. Add timeout to other pages (Bills, Recurring) if they have similar issues
2. Implement progressive loading (show UI skeleton while loading)
3. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Cache API responses in localStorage
5. Use Service Workers for offline support

- Addresses the 42-second page load issue
- Maintains all existing functionality
