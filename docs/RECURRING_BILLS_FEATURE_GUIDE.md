## 2. CSV Import Error Handling

### Error Detection
When CSV contains errors:

- Shows error icon (‚ö†Ô∏è) with count
- Lists up to 5 errors with row numbers
- Indicates if more errors exist
- Orange background for visibility

### Error Actions

- Error message: "‚ö†Ô∏è You must fix or clear these errors before continuing."

### Valid Data Flow
Once errors are cleared:
- Continue button becomes enabled (green)
- All valid items remain in preview
- User can proceed with import

## 3. Enhanced Preview Controls

### Bulk Actions Bar
Located at top of preview items list:
- Green background section
- Two main buttons:
  1. **‚úì Approve All**: Quickly approve all items (disabled if errors exist)
  2. **‚úï Skip All**: Skip all items in preview

### Item Status Badges
Each item in preview shows a status badge next to its name:
- **"New"** (green #00ff88): Item will be imported as new
- **"Will Merge"** (orange #ff9800): Item will merge with existing (‚â•90% match)
- **"Potential Duplicate"** (yellow #ffeb3b): Possible duplicate, user decides

### Individual Item Controls
For each item:
- Type selector (Expense/Income)
- Category dropdown
- Remove button (‚úï) to exclude from import

## 4. Duplicate Resolution

### Smart Defaults

- Items with <90% similarity: Default to "Keep Both"

### Conflicts Screen
Shows detailed comparison:
- Similarity percentage badge
- Confidence level
- Side-by-side comparison of existing vs new item
- Match reasons explanation

### Bulk Resolution Actions
Located at top of conflicts screen:
- **üîÄ Merge All**: Merge all duplicates with existing items
- **‚è≠Ô∏è Skip All**: Skip all new items, keep existing only
- **‚ûï Keep All Separate**: Import all as separate items

### Individual Resolution
For each conflict, user can choose:
- Merge items (updates existing with new data)

- Keep both separately (imports as new item)

Recommended actions are marked with ‚≠ê

## 5. Counter Sync

4. Remember you can undo immediately after

### During CSV Import:
1. Fix or clear all errors before continuing
2. Review item status badges in preview
3. Use bulk actions for efficiency
4. Resolve duplicates based on recommendations
5. Verify final count before completing

### After Operations:

- Check that filters still work
- Confirm items appear as expected
- Use search to verify specific items
