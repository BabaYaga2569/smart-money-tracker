# Dual Balance Display Feature

## Overview
This feature adds support for displaying both **Live** and **Projected** balances throughout the Smart Money Tracker application. Users can now see their actual bank balance (from Plaid) alongside a projected balance that includes manual transactions tracked in the app.

## Problem Solved
Previously, users could track manual transactions in the Transactions page, but these didn't affect the displayed balance from Plaid on the Accounts page. This was confusing for budgeting and planning, as users couldn't see how their pending/planned transactions would affect their available funds.

## Solution
The implementation provides:
1. **Live Balance**: Read-only balance from Plaid (or manually entered)
2. **Projected Balance**: Live balance adjusted for manual transactions
3. **Flexible Display**: Toggle between Live Only, Both, or Projected Only views
4. **Educational Content**: Help section explaining the difference
5. **Visual Indicators**: Icons, colors, and tooltips for clarity

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
- `frontend/src/utils/BalanceCalculator.js` - Core balance calculation utilities

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/Accounts.jsx` - Main accounts page with dual balance display
- `frontend/src/pages/Accounts.css` - Styling for new UI elements
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Dashboard tile showing both balances

### Key Functions (BalanceCalculator.js)

#### `calculateProjectedBalance(accountId, liveBalance, transactions)`
Calculates projected balance for a specific account by adding manual transaction amounts to the live balance.

**Parameters:**
- `accountId` - The account ID or key
- `liveBalance` - Current balance from Plaid or manual entry
- `transactions` - Array of manual transactions

**Returns:** Projected balance as a number

#### `calculateAllProjectedBalances(accounts, transactions)`
Calculates projected balances for all accounts.

**Parameters:**
- `accounts` - Accounts object/array (Plaid or manual format)
- `transactions` - Array of manual transactions

**Returns:** Object mapping account IDs to projected balances

#### `calculateTotalProjectedBalance(accounts, transactions)`
Calculates total projected balance across all accounts.

**Returns:** Total projected balance as a number

#### `getBalanceDifference(projectedBalance, liveBalance)`
Gets the difference between projected and live balance.

**Returns:** Difference amount (positive = pending income, negative = pending expenses)

#### `formatBalanceDifference(difference)`
Formats balance difference for display with descriptive text.

**Returns:** Formatted string like "+$50.00 (pending income)" or "-$25.00 (pending expenses)"

## How Manual Transactions Affect Balances

### Transaction Types
1. **Expenses** (negative amounts): Decrease projected balance
2. **Income** (positive amounts): Increase projected balance

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Pending Expense
- Live Balance: $1,000.00
- Manual Transaction: -$50.00 (grocery shopping)
- Projected Balance: $950.00
- Difference: "-$50.00 (pending expenses)"

#### Scenario 2: Expected Income
- Live Balance: $1,000.00
- Manual Transaction: +$500.00 (paycheck deposit)
- Projected Balance: $1,500.00
- Difference: "+$500.00 (pending income)"

#### Scenario 3: Multiple Transactions
- Live Balance: $1,000.00
- Manual Transactions:
  - -$50.00 (groceries)
  - -$30.00 (gas)
  - +$200.00 (side income)
- Projected Balance: $1,120.00
- Difference: "+$120.00 (pending income)"

## Data Flow

```
1. User adds manual transaction in Transactions page
   ‚Üì
2. Transaction saved to Firebase with account reference
   ‚Üì
3. Accounts page loads both:
   - Account balances (from Plaid/Firebase)
   - Manual transactions (from Firebase)
   ‚Üì
4. BalanceCalculator processes:
   - Groups transactions by account
   - Sums transaction amounts per account
   - Adds to live balance
   ‚Üì
5. UI displays:
   - Live balance (unchanged)
   - Projected balance (calculated)
   - Difference (helpful text)
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Toggle Instead of Always Showing Both?
- **Flexibility**: Different users have different preferences
- **Simplicity**: Some users may not use manual transactions
- **Screen Space**: Mobile users benefit from single-column view
- **Learning Curve**: New users can start with Live only, then explore Projected

### Why Green for Projected Balance?
- Matches the app's accent color (#00ff88)
- Indicates "enhanced" or "calculated" data
- Provides clear visual distinction from Live balance
- Maintains consistency with other UI elements

### Why Tooltips on Labels?
- Provides context without cluttering the UI
- Helps new users understand the difference
- Accessible via hover (desktop) and touch (mobile)
- Consistent with modern web app patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Per-Account Toggle**: Allow different views per account
2. **Historical Projected Balance**: Track projected balance over time
3. **Forecast Chart**: Visualize Live vs Projected over upcoming weeks
4. **Smart Alerts**: Notify when projected balance goes below threshold
5. **Transaction Categories**: Break down difference by category
6. **Bulk Transaction Import**: Quickly add multiple planned transactions
7. **Recurring Adjustments**: Auto-apply recurring transactions to projections

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Bills Page**: Show how upcoming bills affect projected balance
2. **Spendability**: Use projected balance for "safe to spend" calculations
3. **Cash Flow**: Compare projected vs actual trends
4. **Goals**: Show impact of transactions on goal progress
5. **Pay Cycle**: Factor projected balance into payday calculations

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- CSS uses standard properties (no vendor prefixes needed)

## Performance
- Calculations are efficient (O(n) where n = number of transactions)
- No unnecessary re-renders
- State updates are batched
- Firebase queries are optimized with limits
- No performance impact on large transaction lists (tested with 100 transactions)

## Documentation for Users
The in-app Help section provides:
- Clear explanation of Live Balance
- Clear explanation of Projected Balance
- Why there's a difference
- How manual transactions work
- Plaid's read-only nature

Users can access this anytime by clicking the "‚ùì Help" button on the Accounts page.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Questions

**Q: Why isn't my projected balance updating?**
A: Ensure transactions are assigned to the correct account and have been saved successfully.

**Q: Can I edit the projected balance directly?**
A: No, projected balance is calculated automatically. Edit the Live balance or add/remove transactions.

**Q: Why do both balances show the same amount?**
A: You don't have any manual transactions for that account, or transactions have been synced with your bank.

**Q: Will Plaid eventually sync my manual transactions?**
A: No, Plaid only reads from your bank. Manual transactions are app-only and help with planning.

**Q: Can I trust the projected balance for spending?**
A: Projected balance is only as accurate as the manual transactions you've entered. Always verify important transactions.

## Conclusion
The dual balance display feature bridges the gap between read-only bank data and user-tracked planning data. It provides flexibility, clarity, and helps users make better financial decisions by seeing both their current and projected financial state.
