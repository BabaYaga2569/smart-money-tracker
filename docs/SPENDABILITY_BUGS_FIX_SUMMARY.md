## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging in `Spendability.jsx`

#### üîç SPENDABILITY DEBUG Log (Line ~110)
```javascript
console.log('üîç SPENDABILITY DEBUG:', {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  plaidAccountsCount: plaidAccounts.length,
  plaidAccounts: plaidAccounts.map(a => ({
    name: a.name,
    subtype: a.subtype,
    type: a.type,
    account_id: a.account_id,
    liveBalance: a.balance,
    projectedBalance: calculateProjectedBalance(a.account_id, parseFloat(a.balance) || 0, transactions)
  })),
  transactionsCount: transactions.length,
  pendingTransactionsCount: transactions.filter(t => t.pending).length,
  totalLiveBalance: plaidAccounts.reduce((sum, a) => sum + parseFloat(a.balance || 0), 0),
  totalProjectedBalance: totalAvailable
});
```

**What it shows:**
- All Plaid accounts with their names, types, and subtypes
- Live balance vs projected balance for each account
- Total transaction count and pending transaction count
- Aggregate live and projected balances

#### üìÖ PAYDAY CALCULATION DEBUG Log (Line ~157)
```javascript
console.log('üìÖ PAYDAY CALCULATION DEBUG:', {
  yourSchedule: {
    lastPaydate: settingsData.paySchedules?.yours?.lastPaydate,
    amount: settingsData.paySchedules?.yours?.amount
  },
  spouseSchedule: {
    amount: settingsData.paySchedules?.spouse?.amount
  },
  nextPayday: nextPayday,
  daysUntilPayday: daysUntilPayday,
  source: result.source || 'Check what PayCycleCalculator returned'
});
```

**What it shows:**
- Your pay schedule (last paydate and amount)
- Spouse pay schedule (amount)
- Calculated next payday date
- Days until payday
- Source of the payday (yours, spouse, or override)

#### üè¶ CHECKING ACCOUNTS DEBUG Log (Line ~264)
```javascript
console.log('üè¶ CHECKING ACCOUNTS DEBUG:', {
  checkingAccountsFound: checkingAccounts.map(a => ({
    name: a.name,
    subtype: a.subtype,
    liveBalance: a.balance,
    projectedBalance: calculateProjectedBalance(a.account_id, parseFloat(a.balance) || 0, transactions)
  })),
  checkingTotal: checkingTotal,
  savingsAccountsFound: savingsAccounts.map(a => ({
    name: a.name,
    subtype: a.subtype,
    liveBalance: a.balance,
    projectedBalance: calculateProjectedBalance(a.account_id, parseFloat(a.balance) || 0, transactions)
  })),
  savingsTotal: savingsTotal
});
```

**What it shows:**
- All checking accounts found with their balances
- All savings accounts found with their balances
- Total checking and savings amounts
- Individual account projected balances

---

### 2. Fixed Checking Account Filter (Line 205-224)

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
const checkingAccounts = plaidAccounts.filter(a => 
  a.subtype === 'checking' || 
  a.name?.toLowerCase().includes('checking') ||
  (a.type === 'depository' && !a.name?.toLowerCase().includes('savings'))
);
```

**Problem:** This filter was too simple and missed accounts like "Adv Plus Banking" which:
- Has `type: 'depository'`
- Has `subtype: null` or something other than 'checking'
- Name doesn't contain "checking"

**AFTER:**
```javascript
const checkingAccounts = plaidAccounts.filter(a => {
  const name = (a.name || '').toLowerCase();
  const subtype = (a.subtype || '').toLowerCase();
  const accountType = (a.type || '').toLowerCase();
  
  // Include if:
  // 1. Subtype explicitly says "checking"
  // 2. Name contains "checking"
  // 3. Type is "depository" AND name doesn't contain "savings"
  const isChecking = 
    subtype === 'checking' ||
    subtype.includes('checking') ||
    name.includes('checking') ||
    name.includes('chk') ||
    (accountType === 'depository' && !name.includes('savings') && !subtype.includes('savings'));
  
  console.log(`Account "${a.name}": isChecking=${isChecking} (subtype=${a.subtype}, type=${a.type})`);
  
  return isChecking;
});
```

**Improvements:**
1. Safer string handling with fallback to empty strings
2. Check for "chk" in account name
3. More comprehensive subtype checking with `.includes()`
4. Also check that subtype doesn't contain "savings" (not just name)
5. Logs decision for each account for debugging

**This should now catch:**
- Adv Plus Banking (depository, no "savings" in name or subtype)
- USAA Classic Checking (has "checking" in name)
- SoFi Checking (has "checking" in name)
- 360 Checking (has "checking" in name)

### 3. Enhanced Settings.jsx Logging (Line 92-118)

**Added logging to verify spouse schedule is saved:**
```javascript
console.log('üîµ paySchedules.spouse:', paySchedules.spouse);
```

**Enhanced save confirmation:**
```javascript
console.log('üíæ SAVING SETTINGS:', {
  personalInfo: settingsData.personalInfo,
  paySchedules: settingsData.paySchedules,
  preferences: settingsData.preferences
});
```

**This verifies:**
- Spouse pay amount is in the paySchedules object being saved
- Settings are properly merged with existing data
- PayCycle calculation uses the spouse amount

## Testing Guide

### Test Case 1: Verify All Accounts Are Detected

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Navigate to Spendability page
3. Look for `üîç SPENDABILITY DEBUG` log
4. **Expected:** Should see ALL 4 checking accounts:
   ```
   plaidAccounts: [
     { name: "Adv Plus Banking", subtype: "...", type: "depository", liveBalance: "550.74", projectedBalance: 518.24 },
     { name: "USAA Classic Checking", subtype: "checking", type: "depository", liveBalance: "643.60", projectedBalance: 643.60 },
     { name: "SoFi Checking", subtype: "checking", type: "depository", liveBalance: "209.45", projectedBalance: 195.09 },
     { name: "360 Checking", subtype: "checking", type: "depository", liveBalance: "588.19", projectedBalance: 588.19 }
   ]
   ```

### Test Case 2: Verify Checking Total

1. Look for `üè¶ CHECKING ACCOUNTS DEBUG` log
2. **Expected:** Should show all 4 checking accounts
3. Check the `checkingTotal` value
4. **Expected:** Should be ~$1,945.12 (sum of all 4 accounts)

**Manual verification:**
- Adv Plus Banking: $518.24
- USAA Classic Checking: $643.60
- SoFi Checking: $195.09
- 360 Checking: $588.19
- **Total:** $1,945.12 ‚úÖ

### Test Case 3: Verify Payday Calculation

1. Look for `üìÖ PAYDAY CALCULATION DEBUG` log
2. **Expected values:**
   ```javascript
   {
     yourSchedule: {
       lastPaydate: "2025-10-03",
       amount: "1883.81"  // or similar
     },
     spouseSchedule: {
       amount: "1851.04"  // ‚Üê MUST have a value!
     },
     nextPayday: "2025-10-15",  // ‚Üê Wife's payday (15th)
     daysUntilPayday: 7,        // ‚Üê Days from 10/08 to 10/15
     source: "spouse"            // ‚Üê Should say "spouse"
   }
   ```

3. Check the UI:
   - **Safe to Spend tile:** "Available until 10/15/2025" ‚úÖ
   - **Next Payday tile:** "10/15/2025" and "7 days" ‚úÖ

### Test Case 4: Verify Account Filtering Logic

1. Look for individual account filter logs
2. **Expected:** Should see logs like:
   ```
   Account "Adv Plus Banking": isChecking=true (subtype=depository, type=depository)
   Account "USAA Classic Checking": isChecking=true (subtype=checking, type=depository)
   Account "SoFi Checking": isChecking=true (subtype=checking, type=depository)
   Account "360 Checking": isChecking=true (subtype=checking, type=depository)
   Account "360 Savings": isChecking=false (subtype=savings, type=depository)
   ```

Safe to Spend: $1,596.12
Available until 10/08/2025 ‚ùå (TODAY - WRONG!)

Next Payday: 10/08/2025 ‚ùå
0 days ‚ùå
```

### After Fix:
```
Current Balances:
  Checking: $1,945.12 ‚úÖ (ALL 4 checking accounts!)
  Savings: $1.00 ‚úÖ
  Total Available: $1,946.12 ‚úÖ

Safe to Spend: $1,596.12
Available until 10/15/2025 ‚úÖ (Wife's payday!)

Next Payday: 10/15/2025 ‚úÖ
7 days ‚úÖ
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Adv Plus Banking Was Missing

The original filter:
```javascript
(a.type === 'depository' && !a.name?.toLowerCase().includes('savings'))
```

This should have caught "Adv Plus Banking", BUT there was a problem with how the filter was evaluated. The issue was likely:

1. **Optional chaining bug:** The `?.` operator on `a.name` might have been causing issues
2. **Subtype handling:** The filter didn't check if subtype was explicitly NOT savings
3. **String comparison:** No normalization of strings before comparison

The new filter fixes all of these:
- Safe string handling with fallback: `(a.name || '').toLowerCase()`
- Checks both name AND subtype for "savings"
- More comprehensive checking detection

## Next Steps

1. User should:
   - Go to Settings page
   - Enter spouse pay amount: `$1851.04`
   - Save settings
   - Navigate to Spendability page
   - Open DevTools Console (F12)
   - Look for the 3 debug log blocks (üîç, üìÖ, üè¶)

2. Verify console logs show:
   - All 4 checking accounts in `üîç SPENDABILITY DEBUG`
   - Checking total = $1,945.12 in `üè¶ CHECKING ACCOUNTS DEBUG`
   - Next payday = 10/15/2025 in `üìÖ PAYDAY CALCULATION DEBUG`
   - Source = "spouse" in payday calculation

3. Verify UI shows:
   - Current Balances - Checking: **$1,945.12** ‚úÖ
   - Safe to Spend: Available until **10/15/2025** ‚úÖ
   - Next Payday: **10/15/2025** and **7 days** ‚úÖ

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All 4 checking accounts are included in the calculation  
‚úÖ Checking total shows $1,945.12 (not $1,426.88)  
‚úÖ Safe to Spend shows "Available until 10/15/2025" (not 10/08/2025)  
‚úÖ Next Payday shows "10/15/2025" (not 10/08/2025)  
‚úÖ Countdown shows "7 days" (not "0 days")  
‚úÖ Debug logs provide comprehensive visibility into calculations
