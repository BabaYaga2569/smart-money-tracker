## 💡 Why It Worked

**The Problem:**
- Accounts load asynchronously (after 3 seconds)
- `useEffect` didn't have `accounts` in dependency array
- When accounts updated, React didn't re-run `applyFilters()`
- Transactions stayed cached with empty account data

**The Solution:**
- Added `accounts` to dependency array
- When accounts load, `useEffect` triggers
- `applyFilters()` re-runs with new account data
- Transactions re-render with proper bank names

## 🎉 Result

**Minimal 1-line fix that resolves a critical UX issue with zero breaking changes and comprehensive test coverage.**
