# PR #157: Fix Projected Balance Missing Some Pending Transactions

## 🐛 Bug Summary

Projected balance calculation was only counting SOME pending transactions, not ALL of them, causing the projected balance to be incorrect and not match the bank's available balance.

## 📊 The Problem

**Scenario:** Adv Plus Banking Account had TWO pending transactions:
1. ✅ Zelle Transfer: -$25.00 [pending: true] - Oct 12, 2025
2. ❌ Starbucks: -$12.03 [pending: 'true'] - Oct 10, 2025 (MISSING!)

**Before Fix:**
```
Live Balance:      $293.32
Projected Balance: $268.32  ❌ WRONG (only included Zelle)
Difference:        -$25.00  ❌ Missing Starbucks -$12.03
```

**After Fix:**
```
Live Balance:      $293.32
Projected Balance: $256.29  ✅ CORRECT (includes both)
Difference:        -$37.03  ✅ Matches bank available balance!
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `BalanceCalculator.js` used a strict check:
```javascript
if (transaction.pending === true) {
  // Only counted boolean true
}
```

This missed transactions with:
- `pending: 'true'` (string)
- `status: 'pending'` (alternative field)
- Other pending indicators

## ✅ Solution

Changed to an **inclusive** check that looks for ANY pending indicator:

```javascript
const isPending = (
  transaction.pending === true ||
  transaction.pending === 'true' ||
  transaction.status === 'pending' ||
  transaction.authorized === true ||
  (transaction.pending_transaction_id && transaction.pending_transaction_id !== null)
);
```

## 📁 Files Changed

### 1. `frontend/src/utils/BalanceCalculator.js`
- **Lines changed:** 36 (+33, -3)
- **Risk:** Low (only filtering logic, math unchanged)
- **Key changes:**
  - Made pending check more inclusive
  - Added optional debug logging
  - Added pending transaction tracking

### 2. `frontend/src/utils/BalanceCalculator.test.js`
- **Lines changed:** 91 (+91)
- **Added:** 3 new test cases
  - Test 5: String 'true' pending flag
  - Test 6: Status field 'pending'
  - Test 7: Mixed indicators (exact bug scenario)

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Unit Tests
```
✅ Test 1: Pending charges correctly reduce projected balance
✅ Test 2: Only pending transactions included in projection
✅ Test 3: Total projected balance across multiple accounts
✅ Test 4: Projected equals live when no pending transactions
✅ Test 5: Pending as string "true" correctly recognized
✅ Test 6: Status field "pending" correctly recognized
✅ Test 7: Mixed pending indicators all counted
```

**Result:** 7/7 tests PASS ✅

### Scenario Verification

**Exact Bug Scenario Test:**
```javascript
Account: Adv Plus Banking
Live Balance: $293.32

Transactions:
  - Zelle Transfer: -$25.00 [pending: true]
  - Starbucks: -$12.03 [pending: 'true']

Debug Output:
[ProjectedBalance] Account adv_plus_banking: 2 total transactions
[ProjectedBalance] Found 2 pending transactions:
  - Zelle Transfer: $-25.00 (2025-10-12)
  - Starbucks: $-12.03 (2025-10-10)
[ProjectedBalance] Pending total: $-37.03
[ProjectedBalance] Live: $293.32, Projected: $256.29

Result:
✅ Projected Balance: $256.29 (matches bank available)
✅ Both pending transactions counted
✅ Bug is FIXED!
```

### Build Verification
```
✅ Frontend builds successfully with no errors
✅ No new linting errors introduced
✅ All existing tests still pass
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Be Inclusive, Not Exclusive:** When checking for pending transactions, check multiple indicators rather than a single field
2. **Test Edge Cases:** Always test with different data types (boolean, string, etc.)
3. **Add Debug Logging:** Optional debug logging helps diagnose issues in production
4. **Verify Exact Scenarios:** Testing with the exact bug scenario ensures the fix works
