# PR #157 Quick Reference - Projected Balance Fix

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Bug:** Some pending transactions were not being counted in projected balance calculation.

**Cause:** Strict check `transaction.pending === true` missed pending transactions with:
- `pending: 'true'` (string)
- `status: 'pending'`
- Other pending indicators

**Fix:** Made pending check inclusive to catch ALL pending transactions.

## 📝 Changes Summary

| File | Lines | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| BalanceCalculator.js | +33, -3 | Made pending filter inclusive + debug logging |
| BalanceCalculator.test.js | +91 | Added 3 edge case tests |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Old Code (Restrictive)
```javascript
if (transaction.pending === true) {
  // Only boolean true
}
```

### New Code (Inclusive)
```javascript
const isPending = (
  transaction.pending === true ||
  transaction.pending === 'true' ||
  transaction.status === 'pending' ||
  transaction.authorized === true ||
  (transaction.pending_transaction_id && transaction.pending_transaction_id !== null)
);
```

## 🧪 Test Coverage

```
✅ 7/7 tests pass
✅ Exact bug scenario verified
✅ Build succeeds
✅ No linting errors
```
