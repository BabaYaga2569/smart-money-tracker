# Bank Detail Pages Implementation ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented dedicated bank detail pages that allow users to click on a bank account tile on the Accounts page and navigate to a page showing only that bank's transactions.

## Problem Solved
**Before:** User had 474 transactions from 4 different banks all mixed together on the Transactions page, making it hard to reconcile with individual bank statements.

**After:** Users can click on any bank account tile to view only transactions from that specific bank account, with up to 500 transactions per account.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Made Bank Account Tiles Clickable (Accounts.jsx)

**Changes:**
- Added `useNavigate` hook from react-router-dom
- Added `onClick` handler to account cards: `onClick={() => navigate(`/bank/${account.account_id}`)}`
- Added `clickable-card` CSS class for hover styling
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to delete button to prevent navigation when clicking delete

**Code Added:**
```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const navigate = useNavigate();

<div 
  key={account.account_id} 
  className="account-card plaid-account clickable-card"
  onClick={() => navigate(`/bank/${account.account_id}`)}
  style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}
>
```

### 2. Created BankDetail.jsx Page Component

**Key Features:**
- Uses `useParams()` to get `accountId` from URL
- Loads account details from Firebase settings/personal document
- Real-time Firebase listener for transactions filtered by `account_id`
- Limits to 500 transactions per account
- Displays bank header with name, balance, and account number
- Shows account-specific monthly stats (income/expenses/net)
- Includes search bar and filter controls (type, date range)
- Displays transaction list with proper formatting
- Back button to return to Accounts page

**Real-time Listener:**
```javascript
const q = query(
  transactionsRef,
  where('account_id', '==', accountId),
  orderBy('date', 'desc'),
  limit(500)
);

const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(q, (snapshot) => {
  const txs = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
    id: doc.id,
    ...doc.data()
  }));
  setTransactions(txs);
});
```

**Monthly Stats Calculation:**
- Automatically calculates income, expenses, and net for current month
- Updates in real-time as transactions change
- Color-coded display (green for income, red for expenses, orange for net)

**Filters:**
- Search by transaction name, merchant, or category
- Filter by type (income/expense)
- Filter by date range (from/to)
- Clear all filters button

### 3. Added Route in App.jsx

**Route Added:**
```javascript
<Route path="/bank/:accountId" element={
  <PrivateRoute>
    <AppLayout showDebugButton={debugModeEnabled}>
      <BankDetail />
    </AppLayout>
  </PrivateRoute>
} />
```

### 4. Created BankDetail.css

**Styling Features:**
- Dark theme matching existing design
- Green accent color (#00ff88) for consistency
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Card-based layout for transactions
- Color-coded transaction amounts (green for income, red for expenses)
- Prominent stats cards at the top
- Clean, modern UI

**Key CSS Classes:**
- `.bank-detail-container` - Main container
- `.bank-header` - Bank name and balance display
- `.stats-cards` - Monthly statistics grid
- `.filters-section` - Search and filter controls
- `.transaction-card` - Individual transaction display
- `.back-btn` - Back navigation button

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. `frontend/src/pages/Accounts.jsx` - Added navigation on click
2. `frontend/src/pages/Accounts.css` - Added clickable card hover styles
3. `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added route for bank detail page

### New Files:
1. `frontend/src/pages/BankDetail.jsx` - Main page component (376 lines)
2. `frontend/src/pages/BankDetail.css` - Styling for page (425 lines)

## User Flow

1. User navigates to `/accounts` page
2. User sees all their bank accounts displayed as tiles
3. User clicks on a bank account tile (e.g., "USAA CLASSIC CHECKING")
4. Browser navigates to `/bank/{account_id}`
5. BankDetail page loads:
   - Fetches account details from Firebase settings
   - Sets up real-time listener for transactions with matching `account_id`
   - Displays bank header with name and balance
   - Shows monthly stats (income, expenses, net)
   - Renders transaction list (up to 500 transactions)
6. User can:
   - Search transactions by name/merchant/category
   - Filter by type (income/expense)
   - Filter by date range
   - View transaction details
   - Click "Back to Accounts" to return

## Technical Implementation

### Firebase Queries:
```javascript
// Load account details
const settingsDocRef = doc(db, 'users', currentUser.uid, 'settings', 'personal');
const settingsDocSnap = await getDoc(settingsDocRef);
const plaidAccounts = settingsDocSnap.data().plaidAccounts || [];
const foundAccount = plaidAccounts.find(acc => acc.account_id === accountId);

// Real-time transactions listener
const transactionsRef = collection(db, 'users', currentUser.uid, 'transactions');
const q = query(
  transactionsRef,
  where('account_id', '==', accountId),
  orderBy('date', 'desc'),
  limit(500)
);
```

### State Management:
- `account` - Current account details
- `transactions` - All transactions for this account (up to 500)
- `filteredTransactions` - Filtered/searched transactions for display
- `searchTerm` - Search input value
- `filters` - Type and date range filters
- `monthlyStats` - Calculated income/expenses/net for current month

## Benefits

✅ **Better Transaction Management** - Users can focus on one bank at a time
✅ **Easy Reconciliation** - Compare app transactions with real bank statements
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Uses onSnapshot for automatic data refresh
✅ **Performance** - Limits to 500 transactions per account
