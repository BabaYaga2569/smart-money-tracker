## 🎯 Detection Algorithm

### Pattern Recognition Steps

1. **Group transactions by merchant name** (normalized, case-insensitive)
2. **Filter merchants with 2+ transactions** (minimum for pattern)
3. **Check amount consistency** (±$2 tolerance for price variations)
4. **Calculate time intervals** between charges (in days)
5. **Detect billing cycle:**
   - Monthly: 28-32 days apart
   - Quarterly: 89-93 days apart  
   - Annual: 360-370 days apart
6. **Calculate confidence score** (only show 75%+ to user)
7. **Estimate next renewal date** based on pattern
8. **Suggest category** using merchant name keywords
9. **Present with one-click "Add" button**

### Confidence Scoring Formula

```javascript
confidence = (
  (occurrenceScore * 0.4) +      // More transactions = higher confidence
  (amountConsistency * 0.3) +     // Exact amounts = higher confidence
  (intervalRegularity * 0.2) +    // Regular intervals = higher confidence
  (timeSpanScore * 0.1)           // Longer history = higher confidence
) * 100;
```

**Scoring Details:**
- **Occurrence Score**: 2 occurrences = 0.5, 6+ occurrences = 1.0
- **Amount Consistency**: Transactions within ±$2 tolerance / total transactions
- **Interval Regularity**: Intervals matching expected cycle / total intervals
- **Time Span Score**: Months of history / 3 (capped at 1.0)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture

**Detection Flow:**
1. Fetch all user transactions from Firebase
2. Fetch existing subscriptions to prevent duplicates
3. Filter expense transactions (amount < 0) with merchant names
4. Group by normalized merchant name
5. For each merchant group:
   - Sort by date
   - Check minimum 2 occurrences
   - Calculate amount consistency (skip if < 30%)
   - Calculate intervals between charges
   - Detect billing cycle (skip if not Monthly/Quarterly/Annual)
   - Calculate confidence score (skip if < 75%)
   - Check if already tracked (skip if duplicate)
   - Add to results with all metadata
6. Sort by confidence (highest first)
7. Return JSON response

**Performance:**
- Single Firebase query for all transactions
- In-memory processing (fast)
- No external API calls
- Typical response time: < 500ms for 1000 transactions

### Frontend Architecture

**Component Structure:**
```
Subscriptions.jsx (Parent)
  ├─ Header Actions
  │  ├─ 🤖 Auto-Detect Button → Opens Modal
  │  └─ + Add Subscription Button → Opens Form
  │
  └─ SubscriptionDetector (Modal)
     ├─ useEffect → Calls /api/subscriptions/detect
     ├─ Loading State
     ├─ Error State
     ├─ Empty State
     └─ Detected List
        └─ Detected Card (repeated)
           ├─ Header (emoji, name, confidence)
           ├─ Meta (amount, cycle, occurrences)
           ├─ Recent Charges
           ├─ Form (category, essential)
           └─ Actions (add, ignore)
```

**State Management:**
- `loading` - Shows spinner during API call
- `detected` - Array of detected subscriptions
- `scannedCount` - Total transactions analyzed
- `error` - Error message if API fails
- `editingIndex` - Tracks which card is being edited
- `editedData` - Stores category/essential changes
