## 🧪 Test Results

```bash
$ cd frontend/src/utils && node BillVisibilityAndCount.test.js

✅ PASS: Bill count shows total bills regardless of filter
✅ PASS: All Status filter shows bills with any status
✅ PASS: Marking bill as paid changes status but doesn't delete
✅ PASS: Unmarking bill as paid resets status correctly
✅ PASS: Upcoming filter shows pending, urgent, due-today, and this-week bills
✅ PASS: Filter dropdown has options for all bill statuses

✅ All bill visibility and count tests passed!
```

## 🏗️ Build Status

```bash
$ cd frontend && npm run build

✓ 422 modules transformed.
✓ built in 3.66s
```

## 🔍 Key Code Locations

### 1. All Status Filter (Lines 513-514)
```javascript
if (filterStatus === 'all') {
  matchesStatus = true;  // Shows ALL bills
}
```

### 2. Bill Count Display (Line 1645)
```jsx
<h3>Bills ({filteredBills.length === processedBills.length 
  ? filteredBills.length 
  : `${filteredBills.length} of ${processedBills.length}`})</h3>
```
**Result**: Shows "5 of 23" when filtering, "23" when not filtering

### 3. Unmark Paid Button (Lines 1738-1749)
```jsx
{RecurringBillManager.isBillPaidForCurrentCycle(bill) && (
  <button onClick={() => handleUnmarkAsPaid(bill)}>
    Unmark Paid
  </button>
)}
```

### 4. Status Toggling (Lines 581-645)
The `handleUnmarkAsPaid` function:
- Removes payment metadata (lastPaidDate, lastPayment, isPaid)
- **Does NOT delete the bill**
- Updates the bill in database
- Reloads bills to refresh UI

### 5. Filter Logic (Lines 506-531)
```javascript
const filteredBills = processedBills.filter(bill => {
  // Handles search, category, status, and recurring filters
  // 'all' status shows everything
  // 'upcoming' groups multiple statuses
  // Individual statuses match directly
});
```

## 🎯 User Experience Impact

### Before Fix
- Bills appeared to "disappear" when marked as paid
- Count dropped from 23 to 5 without explanation
- Users feared data loss

### After Fix
- Bills never disappear (always in "All Status" view)
- Count shows "5 of 23" - always clear
- "Unmark Paid" button provides easy recovery
- Complete transparency
