# PR Summary: Fix Spendability Calculator Payday Calculation

## Overview
Fixed incorrect payday calculation in Spendability Calculator (showing 10/30 instead of 10/17) by ensuring Settings.jsx saves pay schedule data in the correct format that Spendability.jsx expects.

## Problem Statement
The Spendability Calculator was showing the wrong payday due to a data structure mismatch:
- Settings.jsx saved data as `paySchedules.yours.lastPaydate` (nested)
- Spendability.jsx tried to read from `settingsData.lastPayDate` (root level)
- Result: Unable to read last pay date ‚Üí incorrect payday calculation

## Solution
Added 4 lines to Settings.jsx to save pay schedule data at BOTH locations:
1. **Root level** (for Spendability.jsx to read) - NEW
2. **Nested structure** (for backward compatibility) - EXISTING

## Changes Made

### 1. Settings.jsx (4 lines added)
```javascript
// Lines 121-124
lastPayDate: paySchedules.yours.lastPaydate,
payAmount: paySchedules.yours.amount,
spousePayAmount: spouseSchedule.amount,
```

### 2. Settings.test.js (NEW FILE)
- Created comprehensive test suite with 6 tests
- Verifies root-level fields are saved correctly
- Verifies backward compatibility
- Verifies correct payday calculation (10/03 + 14 days = 10/17)

### 3. Documentation (NEW FILES)
- `PAYDAY_CALCULATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Technical deep dive
- `PAYDAY_CALCULATION_FIX_VISUAL.md` - Visual before/after comparison

## Test Results
‚úÖ **All tests passing:**
- Settings.test.js: 6/6 tests pass
- Spendability.test.js: 8/8 tests pass
- Total: 14/14 tests pass

‚úÖ **Build verification:**
- Frontend build: SUCCESS
- No new lint errors
- CodeQL security check: 0 vulnerabilities

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix ‚ùå
```
Last Pay Date: 10/03/2025
Next Payday Shown: 10/30/2025 (WRONG - defaulting to spouse schedule)
```

### After Fix ‚úÖ
```
Last Pay Date: 10/03/2025
Next Payday Shown: 10/17/2025 (CORRECT - bi-weekly: 10/03 + 14 days)
```

## Database Structure Change

### Before:
```json
{
  "paySchedules": {
    "yours": {
      "lastPaydate": "2025-10-03",
      "amount": "1883.81"
    }
  }
}
```

### After:
```json
{
  "paySchedules": {
    "yours": {
      "lastPaydate": "2025-10-03",
      "amount": "1883.81"
    }
  },
  "lastPayDate": "2025-10-03",      ‚Üê NEW
  "payAmount": "1883.81",            ‚Üê NEW
  "spousePayAmount": "1851.04"       ‚Üê NEW
}
```

## Impact Assessment
