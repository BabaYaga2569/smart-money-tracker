# Payday Calculation Fix - Summary

## Issue
The Spendability Calculator was showing the wrong payday (10/30 instead of 10/17) due to a data structure mismatch between Settings.jsx and Spendability.jsx.

## Root Cause
- **Settings.jsx** was saving pay schedule data in a nested structure:
  - `paySchedules.yours.lastPaydate`
  - `paySchedules.yours.amount`
  - `paySchedules.spouse.amount`

- **Spendability.jsx** was trying to read from the root level:
  - `settingsData.lastPayDate`
  - `settingsData.payAmount`
  - `settingsData.spousePayAmount`

This mismatch caused Spendability to fail to read the correct last pay date, resulting in incorrect payday calculations.

## Solution
Updated Settings.jsx to save pay schedule data at **BOTH** locations:
1. **Root level** (for Spendability.jsx to read)
2. **Nested structure** (for backward compatibility)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Settings.jsx (lines 121-124)
```javascript
// üî• CRITICAL FIX: Save pay schedule data at root level for Spendability.jsx
lastPayDate: paySchedules.yours.lastPaydate,
payAmount: paySchedules.yours.amount,
spousePayAmount: spouseSchedule.amount,
```

#### 2. Created Settings.test.js
Comprehensive test suite with 6 tests to verify:
- Root-level fields are saved correctly
- Nested structure is preserved for backward compatibility
- Spendability.jsx can read from root-level fields
- Correct payday calculation (10/03 + 14 days = 10/17)

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- Last pay date: 10/03/2025
- Next payday shown: 10/30/2025 ‚ùå (incorrect - likely defaulting to spouse's semi-monthly schedule)

### After Fix
- Last pay date: 10/03/2025
- Next payday calculated: 10/17/2025 ‚úÖ (correct - bi-weekly: 10/03 + 14 days)

## Data Flow

```
Settings.jsx (Save)
    ‚Üì
    paySchedules.yours.lastPaydate = "2025-10-03"  (nested)
    paySchedules.yours.amount = "1883.81"          (nested)
    ‚Üì
    lastPayDate = "2025-10-03"                      (root level - NEW)
    payAmount = "1883.81"                           (root level - NEW)
    spousePayAmount = "1851.04"                     (root level - NEW)
    ‚Üì
Firebase
    ‚Üì
Spendability.jsx (Read)
    ‚Üì
    yoursSchedule.lastPaydate = settingsData.lastPayDate
    yoursSchedule.amount = settingsData.payAmount
    spouseSchedule.amount = settingsData.spousePayAmount
    ‚Üì
PayCycleCalculator.calculateNextPayday()
    ‚Üì
    Correct payday: 10/17/2025 ‚úÖ
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
All tests pass ‚úÖ:
- Settings.test.js (6 tests)
- Spendability.test.js (8 tests)

### Build Verification
- Frontend build: ‚úÖ Success
- No new lint errors introduced

## Backward Compatibility
The fix maintains backward compatibility by:
1. Keeping the nested structure intact
2. Adding root-level fields without removing nested ones
3. Allowing gradual migration of any dependent code

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` - Added root-level field saving
2. `frontend/src/pages/Settings.test.js` - New test file

## Files Already Fixed (No Changes Needed)
- `frontend/src/pages/Spendability.jsx` - Already reading from correct root-level fields (lines 142-143, 148)

## Notes
- The bi-weekly pay schedule correctly adds 14 days to the last pay date
- The spouse's semi-monthly schedule (15th & 30th) remains unchanged
- PayCycleCalculator correctly determines which payday comes first
