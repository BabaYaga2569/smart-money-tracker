# Pull Request Summary: Three Critical Bug Fixes

## Overview
This PR fixes three critical bugs discovered during beta testing that were blocking user workflows:
1. **Search Crash** - Black screen when typing in search box
2. **Aggressive Dedupe** - Manual pending transactions being deleted prematurely
3. **Edit Not Saving** - Transaction edits not persisting to database

## Impact
All three bugs affected core user workflows:
- Users couldn't search transactions without crashes
- Users lost track of pending charges they manually added
- Users couldn't edit transaction details

## Solution Summary

### 🔍 Bug #1: Search Crash - FIXED
**Problem:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase')`
**Root Cause:** Search filter tried to call `.toLowerCase()` on null/undefined fields
**Solution:** Added null-safe search with fallbacks for all searchable fields

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before (crashes on null)
t.description.toLowerCase().includes(filters.search.toLowerCase())

// After (null-safe)
const merchantName = (t.merchant_name || '').toLowerCase();
const description = (t.description || '').toLowerCase();
// ... checks all fields safely
```

**Files:** `frontend/src/pages/Transactions.jsx` (lines 729-781)

### 🔄 Bug #2: Aggressive Dedupe - FIXED
**Problem:** Manual pending transactions deleted even when Plaid hasn't received posted transaction yet
**Root Cause:** Dedupe logic didn't check if Plaid transaction was posted (not pending)
**Solution:** Skip pending Plaid transactions + added fuzzy matching with Levenshtein distance

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// KEY FIX: Only match with POSTED Plaid transactions
if (plaidTx.pending) {
  return false; // Skip pending transactions
}

// Enhanced matching with fuzzy similarity (60% threshold)
const similarity = calculateSimilarity(manualName, plaidName);
const fuzzyMatch = similarity > 0.6;
```

**Files:** `backend/server.js` (lines 189-245, 660-808)

**Logging Added:**
- `✅ Deleting manual pending: "X" matched with Plaid posted: "Y"`
- `⏸️  Keeping manual pending: "X" - no posted Plaid match found`

### ✏️ Bug #3: Edit Not Saving - FIXED
**Problem:** Users could click edit, modify fields, but changes didn't persist
**Root Cause:** Missing PUT endpoint + incomplete edit functionality
**Solution:** Added PUT endpoint + comprehensive edit form with all fields

**Backend Changes:**
- Added PUT `/api/transactions/:transactionId` endpoint
- Validates ownership and prevents editing Plaid transactions
- Updates: merchant_name, amount, date, category, notes

**Frontend Changes:**
- Added `editFormData` state for edit form
- Created handlers: `handleEditTransaction()`, `handleSaveEdit()`, `handleCancelEdit()`
- Comprehensive edit form with all fields
- Enter key saves, Save/Cancel buttons work
- Prevents editing Plaid transactions with error message

**CSS Changes:**
- Beautiful edit form with dark theme + neon green accent
- Smooth hover effects and transitions
- Responsive layout

**Files:** 
- `backend/server.js` (lines 1038-1095)
- `frontend/src/pages/Transactions.jsx` (lines 644-744, 1480-1534)
- `frontend/src/pages/Transactions.css` (95 new lines)

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Created comprehensive validation suite (`/tmp/test-bug-fixes.js`):
- ✅ 5 search tests (null safety, various fields)
- ✅ 4 dedupe tests (pending check, fuzzy matching)
- ✅ 3 edit tests (permission checks)
- **Result:** 🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED! 🎉

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ Search works without crashes
- ✅ Search handles null/undefined fields
- ✅ Search finds transactions across all fields
- ✅ Manual pending stays until Plaid posts
- ✅ Dedupe logs show decisions
- ✅ Edit button opens beautiful form
- ✅ All fields editable
- ✅ Enter key saves
- ✅ Save/Cancel buttons work
- ✅ Changes persist to database
- ✅ Cannot edit Plaid transactions
- ✅ Success/error messages shown

### Build Quality
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully (no errors)
- ✅ Backend syntax validated (no errors)
- ✅ No new lint errors
- ✅ Removed unused imports
- ✅ CSS valid and beautiful
