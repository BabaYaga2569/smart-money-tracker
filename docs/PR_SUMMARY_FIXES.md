# PR Summary: Fix Dashboard Spendability and Payday Date Bugs

## Overview
This PR fixes two critical bugs in the Smart Money Tracker application:
1. **Dashboard showing $0** for spendability instead of the correct $1,596.12
2. **Spendability page showing 10/08/2025** (today) instead of 10/15/2025 (wife's payday)

Both bugs are now fixed with minimal, surgical code changes.

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Bug 1: Dashboard Spendability Shows $0
**Issue**: Dashboard "Spendability" tile displayed $0 instead of $1,596.12

**Root Cause**: 
- Dashboard was reading `data.safeToSpend` from Firebase
- This value was never saved to Firebase
- Spendability page calculates it on-the-fly but doesn't persist it
- Result: Dashboard showed 0 as fallback

**Fix**:
- Added spendability calculation to Dashboard.jsx
- Uses same logic as Spendability page
- Formula: `Total Available - Bills - Essentials - Safety Buffer`
- No longer depends on Firebase data that doesn't exist

**Result**: Dashboard now shows **$1,596.12** ✅

---

### Bug 2: Payday Date Shows Today Instead of Wife's Payday
**Issue**: Spendability page showed "Available until 10/08/2025" (today) instead of "10/15/2025" (wife's payday on the 15th)

**Root Cause**:
- `PayCycleCalculator.calculateNextPayday()` only calculated spouse payday if `spouseSchedule.amount` was truthy
- If amount was 0, empty string, or undefined, spouse calculation was skipped
- When both payday calculations failed, error handler returned `new Date()` (today)
- User has spouse schedule configured with `type: 'bi-monthly'` but amount might be empty

**Fix**:
- Updated condition from `if (spouseSchedule.amount)` 
- To: `if (spouseSchedule && (spouseSchedule.type === 'bi-monthly' || spouseSchedule.amount))`
- Now checks for schedule type OR amount
- Spouse payday calculated even when amount is missing/0/empty

**Result**: Spendability page now shows **"Available until 10/15/2025"** ✅

## 📊 Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard.jsx (Lines 133-172)
**Added 40 lines**: Spendability calculation logic

```javascript
// Calculate spendability (same logic as Spendability page)
let calculatedSafeToSpend = 0;
try {
  // Get pay cycle data from Firebase
  const payCycleDocRef = doc(db, 'users', currentUser.uid, 'financial', 'payCycle');
  const payCycleDocSnap = await getDoc(payCycleDocRef);
  
  let nextPaydayDate = new Date();
  if (payCycleDocSnap.exists()) {
    const payCycleData = payCycleDocSnap.data();
    nextPaydayDate = new Date(payCycleData.date || new Date());
  }
  
  // Calculate bills due before next payday
  const RecurringBillManager = (await import('../utils/RecurringBillManager')).RecurringBillManager;
  const billsWithRecurrence = bills.map(bill => ({
    ...bill,
    recurrence: bill.recurrence || 'monthly'
  }));
  const processedBills = RecurringBillManager.processBills(billsWithRecurrence);
  const billsDueBeforePayday = RecurringBillManager.getBillsDueBefore(processedBills, nextPaydayDate);
  const totalBillsDue = billsDueBeforePayday.reduce((sum, bill) => sum + (parseFloat(bill.amount) || 0), 0);
  
  // Get preferences for weekly essentials and safety buffer
  const preferences = data.preferences || {};
  const weeklyEssentials = preferences.weeklyEssentials || 0;
  const safetyBuffer = preferences.safetyBuffer || 0;
  
  // Calculate weeks until payday
  const payCycleData = payCycleDocSnap.exists() ? payCycleDocSnap.data() : {};
  const daysUntilPayday = payCycleData.daysUntil || 0;
  const weeksUntilPayday = Math.ceil(daysUntilPayday / 7);
  const essentialsNeeded = weeklyEssentials * weeksUntilPayday;
  
  // Calculate safe to spend
  calculatedSafeToSpend = totalProjectedBalance - totalBillsDue - essentialsNeeded - safetyBuffer;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error calculating spendability:', error);
  calculatedSafeToSpend = 0;
}
```

**Changed 1 line**:
```javascript
// OLD: safeToSpend: data.safeToSpend || 0,
// NEW: safeToSpend: calculatedSafeToSpend,
```

### 2. PayCycleCalculator.js (Lines 51-56)
**Changed 3 lines**: Updated spouse schedule check

```javascript
// OLD CODE:
if (spouseSchedule.amount) {
  spouseNextPay = this.getWifeNextPayday();
  spouseAmount = parseFloat(spouseSchedule.amount) || 0;
}

// NEW CODE:
// Calculate spouse payday if spouse schedule exists
// Check for schedule existence rather than just amount
if (spouseSchedule && (spouseSchedule.type === 'bi-monthly' || spouseSchedule.amount)) {
  spouseNextPay = this.getWifeNextPayday();
  spouseAmount = parseFloat(spouseSchedule.amount) || 0;
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests Created
All tests pass ✅

**Spendability Calculation Test:**
```
Input:
  Total Available: $1,946.12
  Bills Due: $0.00
  Days Until Payday: 7
  Weekly Essentials: $150/week
  Safety Buffer: $200

Calculation:
  $1,946.12 - $0.00 - $150.00 - $200.00 = $1,596.12

Result: ✅ PASS
```

**Payday Calculation Tests:**
```
Test 1: Spouse with amount set
  Input: { type: 'bi-monthly', amount: 1500 }
  Result: 2025-10-15, 7 days, source: spouse
  Status: ✅ PASS

Test 2: Spouse with type but NO amount (THE BUG!)
  Input: { type: 'bi-monthly', amount: '' }
  Result: 2025-10-15, 7 days, source: spouse
  Status: ✅ PASS (FIXED!)

Test 3: Spouse with amount=0
  Input: { type: 'bi-monthly', amount: 0 }
  Result: 2025-10-15, 7 days, source: spouse
  Status: ✅ PASS

Test 4: Empty spouse schedule
  Input: {}
  Result: 2025-10-17, 9 days, source: yours
  Status: ✅ PASS (Falls back to user schedule)

Test 5: Both schedules configured
  Your payday: 10/17/2025 (9 days)
  Spouse payday: 10/15/2025 (7 days)
  Result: 2025-10-15 (soonest)
  Status: ✅ PASS
```
