# PR #164: Fix Projected Balance - Load ALL Pending Transactions

## 🐛 Bug Fixed

### Problem
Projected balance calculation was **missing pending transactions** because the real-time listener only loaded the 100 most recent transactions. If a pending transaction was older than the 100 newest transactions, it wouldn't be included in the projected balance calculation.

### Example of the Bug
```
User has 3 pending transactions:
- Walmart: -$18.13 (Oct 11, recent)
- Zelle Transfer: -$25.00 (Oct 11, recent)
- Starbucks: -$12.03 (Oct 10, older)

With 100+ transactions across all accounts:
✅ Walmart loaded (in top 100 recent)
✅ Zelle loaded (in top 100 recent)
❌ Starbucks NOT loaded (older than top 100)

Result: Projected balance OFF by $12.03
```

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Dual Query Approach

The fix implements **two separate real-time listeners**:

1. **Recent Query**: Loads 100 most recent transactions (for general use)
2. **Pending Query**: Loads ALL pending transactions (regardless of date)

Both queries use Firebase's `onSnapshot` for real-time updates, and results are merged using a `Map` to deduplicate.

### Code Changes

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Accounts.jsx`
**Lines:** 131-200

```javascript
// Query 1: Get recent transactions (for display/general use)
const recentQuery = query(transactionsRef, orderBy('timestamp', 'desc'), limit(100));

// Query 2: Get ALL pending transactions (critical for projected balance accuracy)
const pendingQuery = query(transactionsRef, where('pending', '==', true));

// Combined transaction map to merge results and deduplicate
const transactionMap = new Map();

// Subscribe to both queries
const unsubscribeRecent = onSnapshot(recentQuery, (snapshot) => { ... });
const unsubscribePending = onSnapshot(pendingQuery, (snapshot) => { ... });
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Before (Broken)
```
Query: Get 100 most recent transactions
Result: 
  - 100 transactions loaded
  - Missing: Starbucks from Oct 10 (older than 100 newest)
  - Projected Balance: WRONG ❌ (off by $12.03)
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Query 1: Get 100 most recent transactions
Query 2: Get ALL pending transactions (regardless of date)
Merge: Deduplicate using Map

Result:
  - 100 recent transactions
  - + All pending transactions (even if not in recent 100)
  - Total: 100-103 unique transactions loaded
  - Included: ALL pending transactions (Walmart, Zelle, Starbucks)
  - Projected Balance: CORRECT ✅
```

## 📊 Benefits

1. ✅ **Accurate Projected Balance** - Never misses pending transactions
2. ✅ **Minimal Performance Impact** - Only loads pending transactions (typically < 10)
3. ✅ **Real-Time Updates** - Both queries use `onSnapshot` for instant updates
4. ✅ **Automatic Deduplication** - Map prevents duplicate transactions
5. ✅ **Multi-Tab Sync** - Works across multiple browser tabs

## 🧪 Testing

### Build Status
- ✅ Build: Successful
- ✅ Linting: No new errors
- ✅ BalanceCalculator tests: All passing

### Verification
```bash
cd frontend && npm run build
cd frontend && npm run lint
cd frontend/src/utils && node BalanceCalculator.test.js
```

All tests pass ✅

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Firebase Query Filters
- **Recent Query**: `orderBy('timestamp', 'desc'), limit(100)`
- **Pending Query**: `where('pending', '==', true)`

### Deduplication Strategy
Uses a JavaScript `Map` with transaction ID as key:
```javascript
const transactionMap = new Map();
transactionMap.set(doc.id, { id: doc.id, ...doc.data() });
```

If a transaction appears in both queries (e.g., a recent pending transaction), the Map automatically handles deduplication.

### Cleanup
Both listeners are properly cleaned up when component unmounts:
```javascript
return () => {
  unsubscribeRecent();
  unsubscribePending();
};
```

## 📝 Console Output

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:

```
📡 [Accounts] Setting up real-time listener...
✅ [Accounts] Recent transactions update: 100 transactions
✅ [Accounts] Total unique transactions: 100
✅ [Accounts] Pending transactions update: 3 pending
✅ [Accounts] Total unique transactions: 103
🔌 [Accounts] Cleaning up listeners
```

This helps verify that:
- Recent transactions are loaded
- Pending transactions are loaded
- Deduplication is working (total count)

---

## 🎉 Result

Projected balance calculation is now **100% accurate** because ALL pending transactions are loaded, regardless of their date or position in the transaction history.

### Expected Console Output After Fix
