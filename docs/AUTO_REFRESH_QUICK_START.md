# Auto-Refresh Bank Account Balances - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 What's New

The Accounts page now automatically refreshes bank account balances in the background - just like Mint, YNAB, and Monarch Money!

## ✨ Features at a Glance

### 🔄 Auto-Refresh on Load
- Open Accounts page → balances refresh immediately
- No waiting, no manual clicking

### ⚡ Smart Background Polling
- **First 5 minutes**: Refreshes every 30 seconds (aggressive)
- **After 5 minutes**: Refreshes every 60 seconds (maintenance)
- Automatically adapts without user intervention

### 👁️ Visual Indicators
Below the "Total Balances" card, you'll see:
- **🔄 Refreshing...** - While fetching new data
- **Last updated: X min ago** - Time since last refresh
- **⚠️ Data may be outdated** - Warning when data is >10 minutes old

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### The Problem
- Plaid caches balance data for 1-6 hours
- New connections show stale balances
- Users had to manually refresh the page

### The Solution
- Automatic background updates catch when Plaid refreshes
- Always see current balances without manual intervention
- Professional UX like leading financial apps

## 📋 How to Use

### For End Users
1. **Open the Accounts page** - That's it! Refresh happens automatically
2. **Watch the status bar** - See when data was last updated
3. **Stay on page** - Balances keep updating in background
4. **Navigate freely** - Cleanup happens automatically when you leave

### For Developers

#### Run Tests
```bash
# Test auto-refresh logic
node frontend/src/pages/AutoRefreshTest.js

# Expected output:
# ✅ Test 1 passed: Shows "just now" for recent timestamps
# ✅ Test 2 passed: Shows "X min ago" for minutes
# ... (8 tests total)
# ✨ All auto-refresh tests passed!
```

#### Build Project
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Should complete successfully
```

#### Monitor in Browser
Open browser console on Accounts page to see:
```
Auto-refresh attempt 1 (30s interval)
Auto-refresh attempt 2 (30s interval)
...
Maintenance auto-refresh (60s interval)
```

## 🔧 Technical Overview

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/Accounts.jsx` - Main implementation
- `frontend/src/pages/Accounts.css` - Visual styling

### New Files
- `frontend/src/pages/AutoRefreshTest.js` - Test suite
- `AUTO_REFRESH_BALANCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical docs
- `AUTO_REFRESH_VISUAL_GUIDE.md` - UI/UX guide

### Key Implementation Details
```javascript
// State management
const [lastRefresh, setLastRefresh] = useState(null);
const [isRefreshing, setIsRefreshing] = useState(false);
const [refreshInterval, setRefreshInterval] = useState(null);

// Polling strategy
- 0-5 min: 30-second intervals (10 attempts)
- 5+ min: 60-second intervals (indefinite)

// Helper functions
getTimeSince(timestamp) → "just now" / "2 min ago" / "1 hour ago"
isDataStale(timestamp) → true if >10 minutes old
```

## ✅ Checklist for QA

- [ ] Open Accounts page - should see immediate refresh
- [ ] Observe "Last updated: just now" after load
- [ ] Wait 30 seconds - should see another refresh
- [ ] Keep page open 5+ minutes - interval changes to 60s
- [ ] Navigate away and back - cleanup works, no errors
- [ ] Check browser console - should see polling logs
- [ ] Run test suite - all 8 tests should pass
- [ ] Build project - should succeed with no errors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Not seeing refresh status bar
- **Check**: Is Accounts page fully loaded?
- **Verify**: Console shows no JavaScript errors
- **Try**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Too many refreshes / Performance concerns
- **Expected**: Aggressive polling first 5 minutes
- **Normal**: Background activity in console logs
- **Note**: Concurrent requests are prevented automatically

### Issue: "Already refreshing, skipping..." in console
- **Status**: This is normal and expected!
- **Reason**: Prevents duplicate concurrent requests
- **Action**: No action needed, working as designed
