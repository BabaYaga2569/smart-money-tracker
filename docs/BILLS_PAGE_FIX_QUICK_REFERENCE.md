# Bills Page Filter Fix - Quick Reference Guide

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
When users marked bills as "skipped", those bills would disappear from the Bills page, even when the 'All Status' filter was selected. This made users think their bills were being deleted.

### The Solution
Fixed `RecurringBillManager.processBills()` to preserve the 'skipped' status. Now skipped bills remain visible in all filter views.

## One-Line Fix

**File:** `frontend/src/utils/RecurringBillManager.js` (line 150)

**Changed from:**
```javascript
status: undefined
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
status: bill.status === 'skipped' ? 'skipped' : undefined
```

## What Now Works

✅ **'All Status' filter** - Shows ALL bills (paid, unpaid, overdue, skipped, etc.)  
✅ **Bill count** - Always displays accurate total count  
✅ **Mark Unpaid button** - Appears for paid bills, allows toggle back to unpaid  
✅ **Skipped bills** - Remain visible and retain their status  
✅ **Status changes** - Bills never disappear when status changes  

## Filter Options

| Filter | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| 📋 All Status | **ALL** bills regardless of status |
| ⏳ Show Upcoming | pending, urgent, due-today, this-week |
| ✅ Paid | Only paid bills (with Mark Unpaid button) |
| 🚨 Overdue | Only overdue bills |
| 📅 Due Today | Only bills due today |
| ⚠️ Urgent (≤3 days) | Bills due within 3 days |
| 📆 This Week | Bills due within 7 days |
| 🔵 Pending | Only pending bills |
| ⏭️ Skipped | Only skipped bills |

## Bill Count Display

**When no filter is active:**
```
Bills (10)
```
Shows total number of bills.

**When filter is active:**
```
Bills (3 of 10)
```
Shows 3 filtered bills out of 10 total.

## Mark Unpaid Button

For bills that are marked as paid, a new orange "Mark Unpaid" button appears:

```
✅ Internet Bill - $89.99
Status: PAID

[Already Paid]
[Mark Unpaid] ← Click to toggle back to unpaid
[Edit]
[Delete]
```

## Testing

Run the tests to verify everything works:

```bash
cd frontend
node src/utils/BillVisibilityAndCount.test.js
node src/utils/BillsPageFilterIntegration.test.js
```

All 13 tests should pass ✅

## Build and Deploy

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

Build should complete successfully with no errors.
