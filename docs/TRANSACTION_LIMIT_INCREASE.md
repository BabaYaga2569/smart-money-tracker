# Transaction Limit Increase - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The Firebase query was limiting transaction retrieval to 200 transactions, causing issues for users with multiple bank accounts. With 267+ transactions across USAA and BofA accounts, this limit was causing:
- Incorrect monthly totals
- Incomplete analytics data
- Missing transaction history

## Solution
Increased the Firebase query limit from 200 to 1000 transactions to accommodate multiple bank accounts with large transaction histories.

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/pages/Transactions.jsx`
**Line 328**: Changed the Firebase query limit

```javascript
// BEFORE
const q = query(transactionsRef, orderBy('timestamp', 'desc'), limit(200));

// AFTER
const q = query(transactionsRef, orderBy('timestamp', 'desc'), limit(1000));
```

## Impact
- ✅ Supports up to 1000 transactions instead of 200
- ✅ Fixes incorrect monthly totals for users with 200+ transactions
- ✅ Ensures complete data for analytics calculations
- ✅ Accommodates multiple bank accounts (USAA, BofA, etc.)

## Technical Details
- **Function**: `loadTransactions()` in Transactions component
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Query**: Fetches user transactions ordered by timestamp (descending)
- **Performance**: No significant performance impact for typical user loads

## Verification
✅ Build successful - no compilation errors
✅ No lint errors introduced
✅ Minimal change - only one line modified
✅ Backwards compatible - works for users with fewer than 200 transactions

## Future Considerations
If transaction counts exceed 1000, consider implementing:
- Pagination for transaction loading
- Virtual scrolling for large transaction lists
- Lazy loading with infinite scroll
- Archive/date range filtering options

## Related Issues
- Addresses users hitting the 200 transaction limit
- Fixes monthly totals calculation for high-volume accounts
- Improves analytics accuracy for multi-account users
