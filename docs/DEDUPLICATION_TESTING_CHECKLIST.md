# Bill Deduplication - Testing Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

Use this checklist to verify the bill deduplication implementation before deploying to production.

## Build & Code Quality

- [x] **Build succeeds** - `npm run build` completes without errors
- [x] **No new lint errors** - Our changes don't introduce new linting issues
- [x] **No new console errors** - Browser console is clean
- [x] **Code is minified properly** - Production build is optimized

## Unit Testing

- [x] **Demo script runs successfully** - `node demo-bill-deduplication.js`
- [x] **All test scenarios pass** - 6 scenarios validated:
  - [x] Triplicate bills detected and removed
  - [x] Case-insensitive matching works
  - [x] Split bills preserved (different dates)
  - [x] Different frequencies preserved
  - [x] Different template IDs preserved
  - [x] Complex mixed scenario handled correctly

## Automatic Deduplication (On Load)

### Test Case 1: Clean Data (No Duplicates)

**Setup:**
1. Start with clean bills (no duplicates)

**Expected Result:**
- [ ] Page loads normally
- [ ] No deduplication notification shown
- [ ] All bills display correctly
- [ ] Console shows: "No duplicates found" (if logging is active)

### Test Case 2: Duplicate Bills Exist

**Setup:**
1. Manually create duplicate bills in Firebase:
   - 3x Netflix ($15.99, Jan 10, monthly)
   - 2x Spotify ($9.99, Jan 15, monthly)

**Expected Result:**
- [ ] Page loads and auto-deduplication runs
- [ ] Notification shows: "Auto-cleanup: Found and removed 3 duplicates..."
- [ ] Only 1 Netflix and 1 Spotify remain
- [ ] Console logs detail which bills were removed
- [ ] First occurrence is kept for each

### Test Case 3: Mixed Scenario

**Setup:**
1. Create bills with both duplicates and legitimate similar bills:
   - 3x Netflix (Jan 10, monthly) - duplicates
   - 2x Rent ($750, Jan 15 & Jan 30, monthly) - split bills, NOT duplicates

**Expected Result:**
- [ ] Auto-deduplication removes 2 Netflix duplicates
- [ ] Both Rent bills are preserved (different dates)
- [ ] Notification shows correct count
- [ ] Console logs show only Netflix removed

## Manual Deduplication (Button Click)

- [ ] Info notification shows: "No duplicate bills found. All bills are unique."
- [ ] No bills are removed
- [ ] Bills list remains unchanged

- [ ] No duplicate bills created
- [ ] Notification shows correct count
- [ ] Bills appear in Bills Management

### Test Case 10: Re-generating Bills (Duplicate Prevention)

**Setup:**
1. Generate bills from templates
2. Immediately click "Generate Bills from Templates" again
