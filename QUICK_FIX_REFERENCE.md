# Quick Fix Reference - Bank Names in Transactions

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Before:** Transactions showed account IDs like `jZJlaLAn46TK4VJOQKwtbmZLNL6slI1wmfBy`  
✅ **After:** Transactions show bank names like `Bank of America` and `SoFi Checking`

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (`backend/server.js`)
**Location:** `/api/plaid/exchange_token` endpoint (lines 446-502)

**What it does:**
- When user connects a bank, backend now updates TWO places:
  - `plaid_items` → Secure credentials (existing)
  - `settings/personal` → Display data with bank names (NEW)
- Includes `institution_name` in API response
- Removes duplicate accounts on reconnection

### 2. Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/Accounts.jsx`)
**Location:** `handlePlaidSuccess` function (lines 478-499)

**What it does:**
- Captures `institution_name` from backend response
- Deduplicates accounts before saving to Firebase
- Prevents duplicate accounts in UI state

## How to Deploy

### Production Deployment (Render.com)
1. Merge this PR to `main` branch
2. Render will auto-deploy backend changes
3. Netlify will auto-deploy frontend changes
4. No manual steps needed

### What to Monitor

Check Render logs for:
```
[INFO] [EXCHANGE_TOKEN] Updated settings/personal with X accounts for frontend display
```

## User Steps After Deployment

1. **Reconnect Banks** (if already connected):
   - Go to Accounts page
   - Click "Connect Another Bank" or reconnect existing ones
   - Complete Plaid Link flow

2. **Verify Fix**:
   - Go to Transactions page
   - Check that bank names show instead of IDs
   - Should see: "Bank of America", "SoFi Checking", etc.

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
User Connects Bank

    ↓
Backend saves to settings/personal (display) ✓ NEW
    ↓
Backend returns accounts with institution_name ✓ NEW
    ↓
Frontend saves to settings/personal (with dedup) ✓ IMPROVED
    ↓
Transactions page loads accounts from settings/personal

```

### Key Files
- `backend/server.js` (lines 446-502)
- `frontend/src/pages/Accounts.jsx` (lines 467-505)
- `frontend/src/pages/Transactions.jsx` (lines 273-301, 1690-1696)

### Firebase Structure
```
users/{userId}/settings/personal/plaidAccounts[]:
  - account_id: "xyz123"
    name: "Checking"
    official_name: "Premium Checking Account"
    institution_name: "Bank of America"  ← This is the key!
    mask: "1234"
    balance: 1500.00
    item_id: "item_xyz"
```

## Rollback (if needed)

If issues arise:
1. The changes are minimal and surgical
2. Backend preserves all existing data (merge: true)
3. Frontend has backward compatibility
4. Can safely revert the PR if needed

## Support

For issues:
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify Firebase has plaidAccounts array
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify bank was connected after deployment

## Success Criteria

✅ Transactions show bank names instead of IDs  
✅ No duplicate accounts in Firebase  
✅ Bank reconnections work smoothly  
✅ All existing functionality preserved  
✅ Logs show successful updates
